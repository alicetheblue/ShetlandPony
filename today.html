			<h2>Today</h2>

				<section id="children">

					<p>Today, Shetlands are ridden by children and are shown by both children and adults at horse shows in harness driving classes as well as for pleasure driving outside of the show ring. They are also seen at petting zoos and sometimes are used for therapeutic horseback riding purposes.

					<h2>Visit Scotland</h2>
			
					<p>VisitScotland released the adorable photos of two diminutive ponies “posing in their winter woollies”. Then they listed all the reasons to travel to Scotland. As if the ponies wouldn’t be enough of a draw, there’s also an abundance of natural beauty and wildlife, a Viking fire festival in late January, a whiskey festival in May and a music festival in July!
